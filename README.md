Weekend Homework - CodeClan Towers
You are being asked to model a hotel. This hotel will contain a collection of rooms of different types (e.g. bedrooms, conference rooms, dining rooms).

Each room will have at least a capacity and a collection of guests.

MVP
Create an abstract Room superclass which will contain the properties/methods common to all Rooms.

Create different types of rooms which inherit from the Room superclass and have properties/methods of their own. (HINT: you may wish to use an enum for the bedroom types with each entry having a value for the room capacity)

Bedroom, which will have a room number, a type e.g. Single/Double, and nightly rate.

ConferenceRoom, which will have a name and a daily rate.

Bedrooms and ConferenceRooms will be chargeable while others (e.g. dining rooms) may not.

Create a Guest class so that guests can be checked in/out of rooms.

Create a Hotel class, which has collections of rooms of different types.

The hotel will be able check guests in/out of rooms.

The hotel will be able to get a list of guest(s), if any, checked into a particular room.

Possible Extensions

Any other extensions you may wish to add.
Remember
Use TDD, with separate test files for each class.
